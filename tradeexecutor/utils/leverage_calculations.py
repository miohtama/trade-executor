class LeverageEstimate:
    """Estimate token quantities and fees for a leverage position.

    A helper class to make sense out of fees when doing leveraged trading on 1delta / Aave.

    - When increasing short, the fees are allocated to the collateral we need to borrow

    **Opening short**

    - Doing 3x ETH short
        - Start with 10 USDC
        - Deposit in Aave
        - ETH price is 1,500 USD/ETH
        - Using swap exact out method
        - The short should be 20 USD worth of ETH, 29.99 USD collateral

    - Deposit 10 USDC to Aave

    - Open position with 1delta protocol contract
        - 1delta takes inputs
        - 1delta initiates swap for 0.0133333333333 WETH to 20 USDC (minus fees)
        - Uniswap v3 calls back 1delta
        - 1delta mints out USDC aToken from USDC we received from the swap
        - We have now total 10 (originak deposit) + 19.99 USDC (new loan) in Aave
        - 1delta borrows WETH for 0.0133333333333 WETH
        - Uniswap is happy has we have WETH we did not have at the start of the process

    - Fee calculations
        - Token in: Borrowed ETH (no fees) 13.3333333333
        - Token out: 19.99 USDC (0.01 USD paid in fees)
    - Final outcome
        - vWETH 0.0133333333
        - aUSDC 29.99

    - `Example transaction <https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/polygon/0xaf9bddedc174dc051abcdb28e6be6bf7f337ce73a9d9ba47bf51b42c04fe0df1?trace=0.0.0>`__

    ** Close short **

    - Closing 3x short as described above

    - Closing position with 1delta
        - Assume price is
        - Get exact wWETH debt amount: 0.0112236255452078143 vWETH
        - Start a swap process on Uniswap with WETH -> USDC for this amount
            - There is no WETH yet in this point
            - Uniswap will tell us how much USDC we will need later down the chain
        - Uniswap calls 1delta fallback called with incoming WETH from the swap
            - Aave loan is repaid with WETH
            - Uniswap tells os the USDC needed to cover the swap cost
            - Atoken USDC colleteral is converted back to USDC to cover the cost of the swap
            - The amount of USDC here is fee inclusive to match 0.0112236255452078143 vWETH,
              so it is wWETH price + fees

        - Total swap cost is = (0.0112236255452078143 / 0.9995) * ETH price

        - Fees are 0.0005 * (0.0112236255452078143 / 0.9995) * ETH price = ETH amount * (fee / (1-fee))
