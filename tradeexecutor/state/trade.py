    Each trade has a reserve currency that we use to trade the token (usually USDC).

    Each trade can be

    - Buy: swap quote token -> base token

    - Sell: swap base token -> quote token

    When doing a buy `planned_reserve` (fiat) is the input. This yields to `executed_quantity` of tokens
    that may be different from `planned_quantity`.

    When doing a sell `planned_quantity` (token) is the input. This yields to `executed_reserve`
    of fiat that might be different from `planned_reserve.

    Trade execution has four states

    - Planning: The execution object is prepared

    - Capital allocation and transaction creation: We move reserve from out portfolio to the trade in internal accounting

    - Transaction broadcast: trade cannot be cancelled in this point

    - Resolving the trade: We check the Ethereum transaction receipt to see how well we succeeded in the trade

    There trade state is resolved based on the market variables (usually timestamps).
